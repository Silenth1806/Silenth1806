- 👋 Hi, I go by Silenth.
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning.
- 🔨 I'm working on a small project right now, but am looking to do something cooler.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever I need to achieve my goals.
- 📫 You can reach me quickly through discord @ **silenth#3439**, but if you want a slightly more professional response I suggest emailing me at **contact@silenth.dev**
